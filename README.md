# 3D Room Visualization

This Python script generates a 3D visualization of a room using the `mayavi` library. The room's dimensions (length, breadth, and height) can be customized.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The script requires the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- mayavi

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy mayavi
```

### Usage

The script defines a function `room_vertices(length, breadth, height)` that calculates the vertices for the floor, ceiling, and walls of a room given its dimensions.

The `length`, `breadth`, and `height` variables define the dimensions of the room. You can modify these variables to visualize a room of different dimensions.

The script then uses `mayavi` to generate a 3D triangular mesh for each component of the room and displays the 3D visualization.
